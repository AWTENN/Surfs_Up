##Results
	
- The Results for the Temperature data for June and December show that:
- The average Temp in June is over 3 degrees Fahrenheit higher than December’s.
- The lowest Temp of December is 9 degrees Fahrenheit lower than that of June.
- There are 183 less observations for December than June.

##Summary

- In Summary, there are not a lot of differences in the Temperatures in Hawaii for the months of June and December. This makes sense considering how close Hawaii close to the tropical zone. The two queries that we could consider doing to gather more weather data on Hawaii would be the measurement of precipitation and the station that took the most of these precipitation and temp measurements, and what the station’s longitude and latitude are. This would be to see where exactly in Hawaii the data was gathered for these measurements.
